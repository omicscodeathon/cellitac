PBMC from a Healthy Donor - No Cell Sorting (3k)  
Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Dataset by Cell Ranger ARC 2.0.0  

Dimensionality reduction plots from two modalities
gene expression data: “gex UMAP” and “gex tSNE”
ATAC data: “ATAC UMAP” and “ATAC tSNE”
Plots to visualize gene expression are labeled “for gene expression search”

Plots to visualize chromatin accessibility are labeled “for ATAC visualization” 

Queryable ATAC data is Transcription factor motif enrichment matrix - prefix your gene of interest with “atac-”

To visualize ATAC-seq fragment data, search for a gene of interest and then click the “Genome” tab.

NOTE: 10x CellRanger ARC matrices translate barcodes to the GEX barcode (reference: https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049105612)
