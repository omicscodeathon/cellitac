Cryopreserved human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a healthy female donor aged 25 were obtained by 10x Genomics from AllCells.

Nuclei were isolated as described in the Demonstrated Protocol- Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365 Rev A). Targeted nuclei recovery was 10,000. Higher recovery was observed, likely due to counting variability.

Paired ATAC and Gene Expression libraries were generated from the isolated nuclei as described in the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338 Rev A) and sequenced on Illumina Novaseq 6000 v1 Kit (Forward Strand Dual-Index Workflow).
