Flash-frozen human healthy brain tissue (cerebellum) was acquired from BioIVT Asterand®.

Nuclei were isolated from a 2605mg section of flash-frozen healthy human brain following the Nuclei Isolation from Complex Tissues for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing demonstrated protocol (CG000375). The isolated nuclei were stained with 7-AAD and then flow sorted using the BD FACSMelody™ cell sorter to clean up the nuclei from the debris. The 7-AAD positive sorted nuclei were then permeabilized using lysis buffer containing digitonin as per the demonstrated protocol.

Paired ATAC and Gene Expression libraries were generated from the isolated nuclei as described in the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338 Rev A) and sequenced on Illumina Novaseq 6000 v1 Kit (Forward Strand Dual-Index Workflow).
