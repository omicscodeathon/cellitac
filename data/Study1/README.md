Cryopreserved human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy female donor aged 25 were obtained by 10x Genomics from AllCells.

Nuclei were isolated as described in the Demonstrated Protocol- Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365 Rev A).

Paired ATAC and Gene Expression libraries were generated from the isolated nuclei as described in the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338 Rev A) and sequenced on Illumina Novaseq 6000 v1 Kit (Forward Strand Dual-Index Workflow).
