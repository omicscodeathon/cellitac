Reverse TF-Centric Modeling of Gene Regulation from scATAC-seq Data

# Overview
Traditional single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis follows a forward approach: 
identify open chromatin regions → find transcription factors → annotate cell types.

Our research introduces a reverse classification paradigm that :
starts with known transcription factors(TFs) and predicts their cell-type-specific regulatory activity patterns.

This innovative approach enables systematic discovery of TF-driven regulatory programs and provides new insights into cellular identity determination and disease mechanisms.
