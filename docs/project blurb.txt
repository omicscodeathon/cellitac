Expected Output / Results:

TF activity scores per cell: A matrix where each row is a cell, each column is a TF, showing predicted regulatory activity.

Cell-type-specific regulatory networks: Graphs showing which TFs regulate which genes in each immune cell type.

Feature importance / master regulators: Identifying the most critical TFs driving cell identity or immune function.

Visualizations: Heatmaps of TF activity, dimensionality reduction plots colored by TF scores, and network diagrams.

Potential targets for therapy: Highlight TFs that could be relevant for interventions or disease studies.
